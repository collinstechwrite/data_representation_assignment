How this works<br>

1. We search a news api <a href="https://newsapi.org">https://newsapi.org</a><br>
2. We save every article title to a remote MySQL database (hosted at <a href="https://www.freemysqlhosting.net">https://www.freemysqlhosting.net/</a>) and Spreadsheet  <p>{{filelocation}}</p> <br>
3. We analyse the articles and count the words<br>
4. We strip out the common words<br>
5. We do a graph<br>

Original Mockup Idea<br>

Can be found in the Jupyter Notebook and within py files in the folder called draft_files

This programs extract brand names that sell food from the openfoodfacts api<br>
This program then searches newsapi for newspaper headlines using a brand name chosen by the user<br>
This program then translates the newspaper headlines into a language chosen by the user - API key was required<br>
This program then saves the translated results to a spreadsheet called analysis.xlsx<br>
This program then saves the translated results to a MySQL database called news - It is requirement that user has database news setup on their local host and same passwords as within code.<br>
This program will then attempt to convert the spreadsheet results into a webpage called Output.html and load the webbrowser<br>

I ran into some issues and ran out of time trying to move all the moving parts over to FLASK. Instability in one api could have a knock on affect on functionality across
other api calls.
